The Disk Mod is a kinda miscellaneous mod. It adds some new stuff, but it isn't an entire overhaul of the game.


1.0.0.3:
-Changed the mod icon!
-Added the Electric Mind Trap.
-When getting hit by the Electric Ball Trap, the gravestone should display the name correctly.
-The glowing mushroom minion now emits much less light.
-The Electric Ball Trap is now white rarity.
-Edited the sprites for the Disk Gun, Flame Ripper, Slime Pop, Bouncy Slime Pop, Combustion Tome, Disk, Meteor Disk, Archery Feather, Motivational Leaf, and Electric Ball Trap.

TODO:
-Add a glowmask to the mushroom.
-Make it so you can shift-equip mushroom glowsticks.
