The Disk Mod is a kinda miscellaneous mod. It adds some new stuff, but it isn't an entire overhaul of the game.


1.0.0.6:
-The Bridge Troll no longer takes lots of knockback.
-The Demolitionist now sell Disposable Sparks.
-You can now shift-equip Mushroom Glowsticks and Disposable Sparks.
-Meteor and Star Disks now emit light.
-The Star Disk, Jumping Cactus, and Bridge Troll now all have dust effects.

TODO:
-Add a glowmask to the mushroom. (hold, partially done)
-Add dust effects to the star disk.
-Fix chance of finding an enchanted quilt and another accessory. (hold)
-Add Lihzahrd Trap part. (hold)
-Add dust for the two enemies.
