The Disk Mod is a kinda miscellaneous mod. It adds some new stuff, but it isn't an entire overhaul of the game.


1.0.0.4:
-Added Aidan's Airgun, Air Pellets, and the Shroomite Shredder.
-Buffed the Disk Gun and Flame Ripper.
-The Electric Mind Trap also enflicts the Cursed debuff.
-Edited the sprites for the Mirror and Pearlwood Wand.
-Remade the sprites for the Disk Gun, Flame Ripper, Slime Pop, Bouncy Slime Pop, Disposable Spark, and Advanced Trap Component.

TODO:
-Add a glowmask to the mushroom.
-Make it so you can shift-equip mushroom glowsticks.
-Add the banner for Jumping Cactus.
-Change the crit strike chance for Aidan's Airgun to 20.
